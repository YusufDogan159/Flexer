In order to run the code you need to open termina on 'Flexer' directory

you need to have python 3.11 (we are not sure if other version is ok or not)
Note: There is image folder. To be able to see icons and logos related path inside the code should be replaced. Also PossibleBookmarkIcon directory is additonal for adding icons when bookmarking in the browser.

This libraries needs to be install by typing below command
pip install PyQt5
pip install PyQtWebEngine

then you can run the browser:
python main.py

Then you can use Flexer
Kind regards.
